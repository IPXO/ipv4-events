📂 Event JSON Format

Each event must follow this structure:
{
  "id": "1981_rfc791",
  "year": 1981,
  "categories": ["Standards"],
  "title": "RFC 791 — IPv4 Published",
  "overview": "The Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) is standardized in RFC 791, defining the dominant packet format for decades.",
  "hashtags": ["RFC791","IPv4","Standards"]
}

Notes
   •  id must be unique, lowercase, words separated by underscores.
   •  year must be an integer (e.g. 1998).
   •  categories must reference existing IDs in categories.json.
   •  overview should be concise (2–3 sentences).
   •  hashtags are short keywords for filtering/search.

Categories live in docs/data/categories.json. Example:

  "label": "Cloud/Virtualization",
  "group": "Infrastructure",
  "iconUrl": "/icons/cloud.ico"
}

   •  Add only if your event cannot fit an existing category.
   •  Make sure you upload a matching icon to docs/icons/.
